POWER N 

Welcome to this improved version of the Power 4 game. Power N allows you to choose how big the board is and how many coins you have to align in order to win (but be reasonable, we're watching you)

.Power N allows you to play against a friend of yours or to play against an AutoPlayer who's been trained for days in order to win every game. But remember he is the best when the power is 4.

Here are the rules of how to play Power N : 
The first player begins by dropping one of his/her discs into the center column of the game board. The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column until one player achieves four in a row -- either horizontally, vertically or diagonally; the player that does so wins the game. However, if the game board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw. 

When you launch the game you'll have to enter the adress of a configuration file, this file should follow some formating rules in order to be read correctly by Power N. You can modify the numbers and the mode.Available modes : HH for Human versus Human, HA for Human versus AutoPlayer, AA for AutoPlayer versus AutoPlayer
------------------ config.txt format exemple:--------------------

width 7
height 6
power 4
HH;

 Don't forger the ';' after the mode chosen !But if you just want to play regular Power 4 game against the AutoPlayer press enter.
Then you'll have to enter the name of the players. Player 1 will be in red and player 2 in yellow. But the first player to play is randomly choosen.
 Finally you'll be asked to choose if you want the game to be display both on the terminal and in the window or just through the window of the app.
